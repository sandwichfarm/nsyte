| 4. Validation | ✗ Not started | 0/? | Phase not planned or executed |

## Requirements Coverage

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS | Integration | Final |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| SPEC-01 | Valid SKILL.md frontmatter | 1 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| SPEC-02 | Directory names match name fields | 1 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| SPEC-05 | Skills in .agents/skills/ | 1 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| SETUP-01 | Install detection + multi-platform | 2 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| SETUP-02 | Project init with auth selection | 2 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| SETUP-03 | Pre-flight validation scripts | 2 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| DEPL-01 | Deploy via nsyte-deploy skill | 2 | passed | — | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| DEPL-02 | Shared Nostr vocabulary | 2 | passed | — | `[x]` | PARTIAL | **partial** |
| DEPL-03 | Error recovery in deploy skill | 2 | passed | — | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| CONF-01 | Config management via skill | 3 | passed | listed | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| CONF-02 | CI/CD deployment via skill | 3 | passed | — | `[x]` | WIRED | satisfied |
| CONF-03 | NIP-46 bunker auth via skill | 3 | passed | — | `[x]` | PARTIAL | **partial** |
| SPEC-03 | Bodies under 500 lines / 5000 tokens | 4 | missing | missing | `[ ]` | — | **unsatisfied** |
| SPEC-04 | Third-person descriptions with triggers | 4 | missing | missing | `[ ]` | — | **unsatisfied** |

## Unsatisfied Requirements

### SPEC-03: All SKILL.md bodies under 500 lines / 5000 tokens (Phase 4)
Phase 4 (Validation) has not been planned or executed. Current line counts are all under 500 (max: nsyte-deploy at 194 lines), but the 5000-token limit has not been formally audited.

### SPEC-04: Third-person descriptions with activation trigger keywords (Phase 4)
Phase 4 (Validation) has not been planned or executed. Current descriptions use third-person verbs but activation trigger keywords have not been formally validated.

## Partial Requirements

### DEPL-02: Shared Nostr domain vocabulary (Phase 2)
`nostr-concepts.md` exists with correct structure and content, but references `nsyte bunker add` (lines 25, 59) which does not exist. The correct command is `nsyte bunker connect`.

### CONF-03: NIP-46 bunker auth via nsyte-auth skill (Phase 3)
Skill body is complete and accurate. However, the prerequisite at line 9 references `nsyte-config` for `nsyte init` guidance — nsyte-config does not document `nsyte init`. Should reference `nsyte-setup` instead.

## Integration Issues

| # | From | To | Issue | Affected REQs |
|---|------|----|-------|---------------|
| 1 | nostr-concepts.md (lines 25, 59) | CLI | `nsyte bunker add` does not exist; should be `nsyte bunker connect` | DEPL-02, CONF-03 |
| 2 | nsyte-auth/SKILL.md (line 9) | nsyte-config/SKILL.md | Cross-reference points to wrong skill for `nsyte init`; should point to nsyte-setup | CONF-03 |

## Broken E2E Flows

### Flow: Nostr-concepts vocabulary → bunker setup
Agent reads nostr-concepts.md for NIP-46 guidance → directed to run `nsyte bunker add <connection-string>` → CLI responds "Unknown command: add" → no recovery path from nostr-concepts.md alone.

**Mitigation:** nsyte-auth/SKILL.md correctly documents `nsyte bunker connect`. Agents loading nsyte-auth directly are unaffected.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated.
