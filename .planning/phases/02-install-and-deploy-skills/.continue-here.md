<current_state>
Phase 1 (Scaffolding) is COMPLETE and verified. Phase 2 directory exists but has no plans yet. Next step is `/gsd:plan-phase 2` in a fresh context window.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Phase 1 (Complete)
- 6 skill directories under `.agents/skills/`: nsyte-setup, nsyte-deploy, nsyte-config, nsyte-auth, nsyte-ci, nsyte-concepts
- All SKILL.md stubs have spec-compliant frontmatter
- `references/nostr-concepts.md` — 71-line Nostr/Blossom vocabulary reference
- All skills pass `skills-ref validate`
- Custom frontmatter fields moved under `metadata:` to pass validator
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Phase 2: Install and Deploy Skills (NEXT — needs planning)
- Requirements: SETUP-01, SETUP-02, SETUP-03, DEPL-01, DEPL-02, DEPL-03
- Goal: Agent can install nsyte on any platform, init a project, and complete a full deploy
- Run: `/gsd:plan-phase 2`

## Phase 3: Config and Auth Skills
- Requirements: CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03

## Phase 4: Validation
- Requirements: SPEC-03, SPEC-04
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- 6 skills grouped by lifecycle: nsyte-setup, nsyte-deploy, nsyte-config, nsyte-auth, nsyte-ci, nsyte-concepts
- Skills in `.agents/skills/` for cross-agent discovery
- nsyte-concepts is background skill (user-invocable: false)
- nsyte-deploy has disable-model-invocation: true in metadata
- Custom frontmatter fields nest under metadata: key
- Config: YOLO mode, quick depth, parallel, balanced models, all workflow agents enabled
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Auth priority order (env var > nsec > bunker) should be confirmed from CLI source before writing deploy skill
- Install method should be confirmed from README/releases
</blockers>

<context>
Adding Agent Skills (agentskills.io) to nsyte CLI. Skills are pure markdown — no code changes. Phase 2 is the core value: install + deploy skills that let an agent take a user from zero to deployed site on Nostr.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase 2` in a fresh context window. This will research, plan, and verify Phase 2 plans.
