<objective>
Update SKILL.md descriptions to include Nostr/decentralized context vocabulary and replace real relay URLs with placeholders in all skill examples.

Purpose: SPEC-04 requires descriptions that activate the correct skill for representative user queries. Descriptions missing "Nostr" or "decentralized" context words will fail to surface when agents search for Nostr-related deployment tools. Real relay URLs in examples violate the no-real-credentials policy.

Output: Five updated SKILL.md files with spec-compliant descriptions and placeholder-only example URLs.

  <action>
Update the `description:` frontmatter field in five SKILL.md files. Each description must:
- Start with a third-person verb (already true for all)
- Include at least one action vocabulary word (deploy, publish, host, install, configure, automate)
- Include at least one context vocabulary word (Nostr, decentralized, static site, Blossom)
- Keep the "Use when..." activation clause

Specific edits:

**nsyte-auth/SKILL.md** — Current description lacks "Nostr". Change to:
`description: Sets up NIP-46 bunker authentication for nsyte, enabling Nostr remote signing without exposing a private key. Use when the user wants to configure bunker auth, connect a remote signer, or manage key delegation for Nostr site deployment.`

**nsyte-ci/SKILL.md** — Current description lacks "Nostr" and "decentralized". Change to:
`description: Configures nsyte for non-interactive CI/CD deployment of Nostr-hosted static sites using environment variable authentication and the --non-interactive flag. Use when the user wants to automate nsyte deploys in a CI pipeline, GitHub Actions, or any headless environment.`

**nsyte-concepts/SKILL.md** — Current description has context vocabulary (Nostr, Blossom, NIP-46) but lacks any action vocabulary word. Change to:
`description: Provides background knowledge about Nostr protocol, Blossom blob storage, pubkeys, relays, and NIP-46 bunker authentication used by nsyte. Loaded automatically when Nostr or Blossom domain context is needed during nsyte operations.`

**nsyte-config/SKILL.md** — Current description already has "Blossom" (context vocabulary) but lacks "Nostr" for broader discoverability. Change to:
`description: Manages nsyte project configuration for Nostr site deployment, including relay URLs, Blossom server URLs, and site metadata. Use when the user wants to configure, update, or validate nsyte settings in .nsite/config.json.`

**nsyte-setup/SKILL.md** — Current description lacks "Nostr", "static site", "decentralized". Change to:
`description: Installs nsyte, the CLI for deploying static sites to the decentralized Nostr network. Use when the user wants to install nsyte, check if nsyte is installed, set up nsyte for the first time, or troubleshoot installation on Linux, macOS, or Windows.`

Do NOT modify nsyte-deploy — its description already meets both action and context vocabulary requirements.

  <action>
Replace all real relay URLs in SKILL.md example code blocks and inline examples with placeholder URLs.

Substitution rules:
- `wss://relay.nsec.app` → `wss://relay.example.com` (in nsyte-auth and nsyte-ci)
- `wss://relay.damus.io` → `wss://relay.example.com` (in nsyte-setup)

Specific locations:

**nsyte-auth/SKILL.md line 27**: `wss://relay.nsec.app` → `wss://relay.example.com`
**nsyte-auth/SKILL.md line 36**: `wss://relay.nsec.app` in bunker URL → `wss://relay.example.com`
**nsyte-ci/SKILL.md line 27**: `wss://relay.nsec.app` in bunker URL → `wss://relay.example.com`
**nsyte-setup/SKILL.md line 86**: `wss://relay.damus.io` → `wss://relay.example.com`

Do NOT modify `.agents/skills/nsyte-concepts/references/nostr-concepts.md` — that file is agent guidance (telling agents what relays to suggest), not example code. The nostr-concepts references file is not a SKILL.md body and its relay mentions are instructional, not example placeholders.
