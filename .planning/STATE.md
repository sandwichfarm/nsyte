## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Multiple skills over single skill: Agents load only what's relevant; better progressive disclosure
- Skills live in nsyte repo: Ship with CLI, versioned together, single source of truth
- Cover all v1 commands: Install, deploy, config, CI, auth — full lifecycle without gaps

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: nsyte auth priority order (env var > nsec > bunker) should be confirmed against CLI source or `--help` before writing deploy skill
- Phase 2: Current nsyte install method (exact command) should be confirmed from project README/releases
- Phase 3: `.nsite/config.json` schema completeness needs verification from nsyte source before writing config reference
