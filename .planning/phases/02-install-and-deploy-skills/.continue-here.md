<current_state>
Phase 1 (Scaffolding) is COMPLETE and verified. Phase 2 (Install and Deploy Skills) has NOT been planned or started yet. The next step is to plan Phase 2.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## This Session

- Project initialized with `/gsd:new-project` — PROJECT.md, config.json, research, requirements, roadmap all committed
- Codebase mapped with `/gsd:map-codebase` — 7 documents in `.planning/codebase/`
- Phase 1 planned with `/gsd:plan-phase 1` — 2 plans in 2 waves, verified by plan checker
- Phase 1 executed with `/gsd:execute-phase 1` — both plans complete, verified passing

## Phase 1 Deliverables
- 6 skill directories under `.agents/skills/`: nsyte-setup, nsyte-deploy, nsyte-config, nsyte-auth, nsyte-ci, nsyte-concepts
- All SKILL.md stubs have spec-compliant frontmatter (name/description match directories)
- `references/nostr-concepts.md` — 71-line Nostr/Blossom vocabulary reference
- All skills pass `skills-ref validate`
- Notable fix: custom frontmatter fields (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`) moved under `metadata:` to pass validator
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Phase 2: Install and Deploy Skills
- Requirements: SETUP-01, SETUP-02, SETUP-03, DEPL-01, DEPL-02, DEPL-03
- Goal: Agent can install nsyte on any platform, initialize a project, and complete a full deploy
- Needs: `/gsd:plan-phase 2` then `/gsd:execute-phase 2`

## Phase 3: Config and Auth Skills
- Requirements: CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03
- Goal: Config management, NIP-46 bunker auth, CI/CD setup

## Phase 4: Validation
- Requirements: SPEC-03, SPEC-04
- Goal: Token budget compliance, description quality, final spec validation
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Multiple skills over monolithic: 6 skills grouped by lifecycle phase (setup, deploy, config, auth, ci, concepts)
- Skills live in `.agents/skills/` for cross-agent discovery (not `.claude/skills/`)
- `nsyte-concepts` is a background skill (`user-invocable: false`) holding shared Nostr vocabulary
- `nsyte-deploy` has `disable-model-invocation: true` in metadata
- Custom frontmatter fields must be nested under `metadata:` to pass skills-ref validator
- Config: YOLO mode, quick depth, parallel execution, balanced models, all workflow agents enabled
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — clean state, ready for Phase 2 planning.

<context>
This project adds Agent Skills (agentskills.io) to the nsyte CLI so AI agents can discover and use nsyte for deploying static sites to the Nostr network. The skills are pure markdown files — no Deno code changes needed. Research identified that description quality and progressive disclosure are the critical success factors. Each SKILL.md body should stay under 500 lines/5000 tokens.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:plan-phase 2` to create plans for the Install and Deploy skills. This is the core value delivery — agents being able to go from zero to deployed site.
