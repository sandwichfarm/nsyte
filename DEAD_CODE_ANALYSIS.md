# Dead Code Analysis Report

## Summary

After a comprehensive analysis of the nsyte codebase, I found very few truly unused files. The codebase appears to be well-maintained with minimal dead code.

## Analysis Results

### 1. Truly Unused Files
**None found.** All TypeScript and JavaScript files in the codebase are either:
- Imported by other files
- Entry points (CLI, scripts with shebangs)
- Test files (run directly by the test runner)
- Configuration files
- Documentation assets

### 2. Potentially Obsolete Files

The following files have naming patterns suggesting they might be temporary fixes that could potentially be removed:

- `tests/unit/bunker_direct_test_fixed.ts` - The '_fixed' suffix suggests this was a temporary fix
- `tests/unit/bunker_test_fixed.ts` - The '_fixed' suffix suggests this was a temporary fix

**Recommendation**: Review these test files to determine if they can be removed or if they should be renamed to remove the '_fixed' suffix.

### 3. Test File Duplication

Found one case where test files might be consolidated:

- `tests/integration/secrets_test.ts` (3,545 bytes)
- `tests/unit/secrets_test.ts` (6,800 bytes)

While it's normal to have both unit and integration tests, review these to ensure there's no unnecessary duplication of test cases.

### 4. Script Files

The following script files in the `scripts/demo/` directory are not imported by any other files but are legitimate entry points:

- `scripts/demo/generate-asciinema.ts` - Generates asciinema recordings (has shebang, meant to be run directly)
- `scripts/demo/generate-real-demo.ts` - Generates demo content using actual CLI output (has shebang, meant to be run directly)

These are documented in `scripts/demo/README.md` and are used to generate demo content for the project.

## Verification Steps Taken

1. **Import Analysis**: Scanned all files for ES6 imports, dynamic imports, require statements, and export statements
2. **Entry Point Detection**: Identified files referenced in deno.json tasks and files with shebangs
3. **Test File Analysis**: Recognized that test files are run directly by the test runner
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Looked for files with names suggesting they might be temporary or deprecated

## Recommendations

1. **Review Fixed Tests**: Examine the two test files with '_fixed' suffix to determine if they can be removed or renamed
2. **Consider Test Consolidation**: Review the secrets tests to eliminate any duplication between unit and integration tests
3. **Keep Demo Scripts**: The demo generation scripts should be retained as they serve a documented purpose

## Conclusion

The nsyte codebase is remarkably clean with essentially no dead code. The only actionable items are:
- Two test files with '_fixed' suffixes that might be obsolete
- Potential consolidation opportunity for secrets tests

This indicates good code maintenance practices and regular cleanup of unused code.
